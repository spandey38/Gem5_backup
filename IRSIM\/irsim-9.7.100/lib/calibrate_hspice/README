This directory does the calibration run for hspice based models.
It uses the measure capability of hspice to extract resistances
the same way the ../calibrate_spice3 programs do.

You might need to tune the script a bit for you local environment.
Since it assumes that hspice is called with a library called
opConditions.lib which defines the supply voltage (Supply) based 
on the parameter Sup (which is in turn defined in the dev.example
file).
