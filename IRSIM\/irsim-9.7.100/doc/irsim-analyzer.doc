                                                irsim-analyzer(3)

NAME
     irsim-analyzer

SYNOPSIS
     analyzer node...

DESCRIPTION
     The analyzer provides a graphical interface to irsim;
     displaying the state of the nodes (or vectors) node...

     Every invocation of the analyzer command adds a new set of
     signals to the display list.

     The view is split into 3 regions: a trace window, a text
     window, and a banner.  The banner displays the name of the
     simulation (from the sim file), and the pull-down menu
     headers.  The text window is a 1-line window used to request
     and display certain information.

     The trace window displays the following information:

     left side:   names of the signals (nodes/vectors) displayed.

     top side:    On the left and right sides, the time
                  corresponding to the left and right edges of
                  the trace window.  In the center, the time of
                  the current cursor position.

     right side:  Values of the signals under the cursor.


MENU FUNCTIONS
     zoom:
           in   Zooms in by a factor of 2 (magnify).

           out  Zooms out by a factor of 2 (reduce).

     base:  Changes the numerical base used to display the value
            of the selected vector (see below how to select a
            trace) to one of the following:
              bin  (base 2)
              oct  (base 8)
              hex  (base 16)

     window:1

          delta T     Allows to determine the difference (in
                      time) between any two edges.   First click
                      the mouse (any button) to the right of the
                      first edge, then to the left of the second
                      edge.  The time of the two edges as well as
                      their difference will be shown in the text
                      window.  As long as the button remains
                      depressed, a line is shown between the two
                      edges.  Times are all shown in ns.

          move to     Moves the left edge of the trace window to
                      the specified time.  The time is requested
                      in the text window.

          set width   Sets the number of ns. that will be
                      displayed.  The time is requested in the
                      text window.

          name length Since the most important differentiating
                      information in a long signal name is
                      usually at the end, the analyzer will
                      display the last 15 characters of a signal
                      name.  This option allows changing the
                      maximum number of characters that will be
                      displayed, which must be in the range [8-
                      256].

          scroll      Usually the analyzer displays simulation
                      activity by scrolling the traces to the
                      left, so the last changes are shown. The
                      scroll feature enables/disables this
                      scrolling, effectively freezing the traces.
                      When scrolling is enabled, a check mark is
                      shown on this menu entry.

     print:  These options control the generation of a PostScript
             file suitable for obtaining a hardcopy of the trace
             window.

             file    Requests the filename to hold the PostScript
                     output.  Hitting <return> will use the
                     default name (shown in parens).  Hitting
                     <ctrl-C> will abort generation of the file.
                     The following menu entries control the
                     aspect of the PostScript file; a check mark
                     in the corresponding menu entry implies that
                     the feature will be included in the output.

             banner  Generate a banner, showing the simulation
                     name and current date.

             legend  Generate (in a separate page) a description
                     of the signals displayed: the complete names
                     of nodes (since the first characters may be
                     stripped), and for vectors the names of the
                     nodes of wich it is composed.

             times   Generate a time ruler at the bottom of the
                     traces.

             outline Draw an outline around the trace window.

MOUSE FUNCTIONS
     The analyzer provides various functions depending on where
     in the window a mouse button is depressed.  All buttons have
     the same meaning, except inside the scrollbar.  Pressing a
     mouse button in the following regions will provide:

     Signal names:
          The signal name where the button was depressed will be
          highlighted and will be moved to the position where the
          button is released, scrolling the other traces if
          necessary.  If the button is released under the same
          signal on which it was pressed, that signal will become
          selected. The selected signal is always underlined, and
          some information regarding that signal is printed in
          the text window.

          If the button is released outside the traces area
          (above or below) the signal will be removed from the
          display.  It can only be added again by invoking the
          analyzer command.

     Left Arrow:
          The traces are scrolled left by half a page (move back
          in time).

     Right Arrow:
          The traces are scrolled right by half a page (move
          forward in time).

     Double Left Arrow:
          Scrolls traces left by a full page.

     Double Right Arrow:
          Scrolls traces right by a full page.

     Scrollbar:
          The left button allows to stretch the left side of the
          window, thereby zooming in/out by an arbitrary amount.
          The right side of the window remains the same.

          The right button allows to stretch the right side of
          the window, thereby zooming in/out by an arbitrary
          amount.  The left side of the window remains the same.

          The middle button moves the whole view back and forth
          in time.  The magnification factor remains the same.

     Traces
          The cursor is moved to the time-step where the mouse is
          clicked.  Some lack of accuracy in selecting the time
          may become apparent due to screen resolution round off.

          Holding down the shift key simultaneously with the
          mouse button will not move the cursor, but rather show
          the value of the signal at the time-step where the
          mouse is clicked.  The value is printed in the text
          window using the following format:

               name @  time:value=value,input=status

          The value is always shown in binary, regardless of the
          base selected for that signal.  The status is a string
          showing which nodes where inputs at that time.  Nodes
          that were inputs have an i in their respective
          position, otherwise an -.

     Cursor Values:
          The selected signal value is highlighted and, when the
          button is released, the value of the signal is expanded
          in the text window.  This is useful for displaying each
          of the bits that make up a vector.  The information
          printed has the following format:

                name:value=value input=status

          where value and status have the same meaning as above.

     Banner:
          Clicking on the banner brings the window to the
          foreground.

     Box on Banner:
          Clicking in the little box on the left side of the
          banner iconizes the analyzer window.  To de-iconize the
          window, simply click any button within the icon.

     Banner Menus:
          Pressing a mouse button in one of the banner menus (on
          the right side) will pull down the corresponding menu.



X DEFAULTS
     The analyzer application uses the appropriate resource
     specification at startup time to customize the appearance of
     its window.  The format for a resource specification in the
     .Xdefaults file is:

               [name.]resource:  value

     For the analyzer, the available names are irsim and
     analyzer. The available resources are:
