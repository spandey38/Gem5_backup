                                                     NETCHANGE(5)

NAME
     netchange - format of netchange files read by irsim.


DESCRIPTION
     A netchange file consists of a series of lines, each of
     which begins with a key letter.  The key letter beginning a
     line determines how the remainder of the line is inter-
     preted.  The following are the list of key letters under-
     stood.

          Lines beginning with a vertical bar are treated as com-
          ments and ignored by the program.

     add type gate source drain length width [area]
          Add a new transistor of type to the network.
          Currently, type may be:
            n   n-channel enhancement transistor.
            p   p-channel enhancement transistor.
            d   depletion transistor (for NMOS).

          The names of the nodes to which the gate, source, and
          drain of the transistor are connected are given by
          gate, source, and drain respectively.  The length and
          width of the transistor are given by length and width
          respectively.  The area parameter, if given, will use
          that number as the area for calculating the gate capa-
          citance.  Length and width should be given in lambda
          units, area should be in lambda^2 units, these will
          internally be multiplied by the LAMBDA factor from the
          configuration (.prm) file.

     delete type gate source drain length width [area]
          Delete an existing transistor from the net.  All the
          parameters have the same meaning as for the add com-
          mand.

     move type gate source drain length width [area] g s d
          Move an existing transistor to a new location the net.
          type, gate, source, drain, length, width, have the same
          meaning as for the add command.  g, s, and d are the
          names of nodes to which the gate, source and drain
          should be connected.  If a particular terminal(s) is
          not to be re-connected, the name can be specified using
          an "*".  Any or all of g, s, and d may be "*".  For
          example, to move the gate of an n-channel transistor
          from node old to new the following command would be
          used:

               m n old src_node drn_node 4 2.2 new * *

          Note that the drain and source terminals, and the g and
          s terminals are interchangeable; the simulator will
          know if these are swapped.  So the last example could
          also have been written:

               m n old drn_node src_node 4 2.2 new * *

     capacitance node value
          Change the capacitance of a node by value picofarads.
          Value may be negative, thereby decreasing the node's
          capacitance.  Node is the node name.

     N node metal-area poly-area diff-area diff-perimeter
          Change the capacitance of node using the area and per-
          imeter information of the metal, polysilicon, and dif-
          fusion layers.  All the parameters should be in lambda
          (or lambda^2 for areas) units, they will internally be
          converted to the appropriate capacitance as defined in
          the configuration file.  The values can be negative to
          decrease the capacitance.

     M node M2A M2P MA MP PA PP DA DP PDA PDP
          Change the capacitance of node, using the following
          geometrical information:

            M2A   area of 2nd-level metal
            M2P   perimeter of 2nd-level metal
            MA    area of 1st-level metal
            MP    perimeter of 1st-level metal
            PA    area of polysilicon
            PP    perimeter of polysilicon
            DA    area of n-diffusion
            DP    perimeter of n-diffusion
            PDA   area of p-diffusion
            PDP   perimeter of p-diffusion

          All perimeter values should be in lambda units, area
          values should be in lambda^2 units.  The perimeter
          measures are half of the actual total perimeter (i.e.,
          they are the sum of the lengths of the top and one
          side).  Again, the values may be negative to decrease
          the capacitance of the node.

     threshold node low high
          Change the threhsold voltages of node. Low and high
          should be in normalized voltage units (i.e. floating-
          point numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0).

     Delay node tplh tphl
          Change the delays for node to be tplh nanoseconds for
          low-to-high transistions, and tphl ns. for high-to-low
          transistions.  These should be absolute numbers, not
          relative increments/dercrements.

     NOTE: For all commands, only the first letter is signifi-
           cant, the rest of the string will be ignored.  They
           are only shown here for clarity.


BUGS
     This is an experimental interface for the incremental simu-
     lator and is very likely to change in the future.
